### Hello, I'm Federico 👋

I am currently working on my MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy at The University of Chicago. I also work as a Data Scientist on a wide variety of projects, including webscraping, supervised and unsupervised maxchine learning models, data visualization and process automation. I also have designed the underlying AWS architecture in most of the projects I have worked.

- 🛠️: My skills are: Python, SQL, R, AWS and GitHub.
- ⭐: Proficient in: Webscraping, Data Manipulation, Machine Learning
- 📖 Currently working on: Natural Language Processing and AWS.

Some of the projects that I have worked on, among others, are:

- Design webscraping pipelines to visualize goods' prices over time.
- Supervised Machine Learning to predict price changes over time.
- Unsupervised Machine Learning to create recommender systems.
- Real time media alerts.

You can see some of my work on the following repositories:

1) [Streamlit App to extract CO2 emissions data in real time](https://github.com/City-of-Long-Beach-Public/climate_inventory): I worked with the City of Long Beach (CA) to automate their data extraction process from public websites. As a result, I created a Streamlit app that allows them to select the website they want and the year of interest. They can also download the data into their local computer.
     
3) [Weekly alert system to manage household expenses via Splitwise's API](https://github.com/FedericoDM/splitwise-household-expenses): In pro of managing better our household's budget and expenses, I created a pipeline that extracts our expenses data from the Splitwise API. Then, every week, we get an e-mail that summarizes our expenses for the current month.

  
5) [API extraction codes I have used in other projects](https://github.com/FedericoDM/API-extractions): You can mostly find some code samples of API extractions I have done in the past for different projects. These range from Financial to Government APIs.
   
7) [Some webscraping side projects I have previously worked on](https://github.com/FedericoDM/webscraping-sideprojects): Here, you can find some code I created to extract data from different websites, per different clients' request. In these cases, the main goal was to get and deliver the clean data to the final user.
