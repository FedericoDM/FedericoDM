### Hello, I'm Federico 👋

I am currently working as a Data Scientist at the [Energy and Environment Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment) at the University of Chicago. I obtained my MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy at the same institution, where I delved deep into Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Cloud Computing.

I have worked on a wide variety of projects, including webscraping, supervised and unsupervised ML models, data visualization and process automation. I also have designed the underlying AWS architecture in most of the projects I have worked. 

Feel free to take a look at my [resume](https://github.com/FedericoDM/FedericoDM/blob/main/CS%20Resume%20-%20FDM.pdf) and to connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-dominguez-molina/).

- 🐍: The programming languages I use are: Python, SQL, C and R.
- ☁️: Cloud Computing Stack: AWS (EC2, Lambda, Route53, SQS).
- 📊: Other skills: Power BI, Databricks, Elasticsearch.
- 📖 Currently working on: Natural Language Processing and AWS.

Some of the projects that I have worked on, among others, are:

- Design webscraping pipelines to visualize goods' prices over time.
- Supervised Machine Learning to predict price changes over time.
- Unsupervised Machine Learning to create recommender systems.
- Real time media alerts.

You can see some of my work on the following repositories:

1) 🌲 [Streamlit App to extract CO2 emissions data in real time](https://github.com/City-of-Long-Beach-Public/climate_inventory): I worked with the City of Long Beach (CA) to automate their data extraction process from public websites. As a result, I created a Streamlit app that allows them to select the website they want and the year of interest. They can also download the data into their local computer.
     
2) 💰 [Weekly alert system to manage household expenses via Splitwise's API](https://github.com/FedericoDM/splitwise-household-expenses): In pro of managing better our household's budget and expenses, I created a pipeline that extracts our expenses data from the Splitwise API. Then, every week, we get an e-mail that summarizes our expenses for the current month.

3) 💬 [Natural Language Processing Analysis of the Mexican's President Daily Conferences](https://github.com/FedericoDM/AMLO-NLP): As part of a class project (and also personal interest), I scraped all of the president's morning conferences and trained a model to assign each conference an 'aggressivity score', based on how hostile he is on the press conference. 

4) 🗺️ [API extraction codes I have used in other projects](https://github.com/FedericoDM/API-extractions): You can mostly find some code samples of API extractions I have done in the past for different projects. These range from Financial to Government APIs.
   
5) 📊 [Some webscraping side projects I have previously worked on](https://github.com/FedericoDM/webscraping-sideprojects): Here, you can find some code I created to extract data from different websites, per different clients' request. In these cases, the main goal was to get and deliver the clean data to the final user.
