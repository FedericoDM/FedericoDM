### Hello, I'm Federico üëã

I am currently working on my MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy at The University of Chicago. I also work as a Data Scientist on a wide variety of projects (from Web Scraping to Unsupervised Machine Learning).


- üõ†Ô∏è: My skills are: Python, SQL, R, AWS and GitHub.
- ‚≠ê: Proficient in: Webscraping, Data Manipulation, Machine Learning
- üìñ Currently working on: Unstructured Data Analysis, Parallel Programming, Design Patterns.


Some of the projects that I have worked on, among others, are:

- Design webscraping pipelines to visualize goods' prices over time.
- Supervised Machine Learning to predict price changes over time.
- Unsupervised Machine Learning to create recommender systems.
- Real time media alerts.

You can see some of my work on the following repositories:

1) [Streamlit App to extract CO2 emissions data in real time](https://github.com/City-of-Long-Beach-Public/climate_inventory).
2) [Weekly alert system to manage household expenses via Splitwise's API](https://github.com/FedericoDM/splitwise-household-expenses).
3) [API extraction codes I have used in other projects](https://github.com/FedericoDM/API-extractions).
4) [Some webscraping side projects I have previously worked on](https://github.com/FedericoDM/webscraping-sideprojects).
